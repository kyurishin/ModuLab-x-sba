Before we get started with GitHub, a collaboration and versioning tool that we'll learn in detail today, let's start by introducing some of the most used and not difficult *communication and productivity apps.* If you are going to continue exploring the field of development or artificial intelligence in the future, these are tools that can be covered a lot, so it would be nice to keep them familiar!\n",
